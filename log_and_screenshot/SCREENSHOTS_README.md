Since professor did not mention about screenshots until Dec10, there will not be enough time to complete another training. Here is the training log and screenshots.

the training process may vary while im making the screen bigger or smaller. It creates a lot of repeat loading bars. I will here provide some couple more pictures of different screen size to show the training process
