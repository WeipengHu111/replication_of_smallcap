data is too big to load

Download all COCO images (train, val and test, 2017 version) from [here](https://cocodataset.org/#download) and place them in `data/images`. The expected naming format is twelve digits followed by a `.jpg` extension, e.g. `data/images/000000000001.jpg` for image with COCO id `1`.
